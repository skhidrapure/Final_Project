# Final_Project
## Git Repository


In Git, the repository is like a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories. It contains the collection of the files as well as the history of changes made to those files. Repository in Git is considered as your project folder. A repository has all the project-related data.
 
Our Git Repository is called the Final_Project which has 4 branches & a README. 
1. git-master
2. ml-master
3. db-master
4. tech-master
5. README


These are the branches where all our works are going to stored & made accessible to rest of the team members. The README is the one which will have all the written report of the entire analysis.
