# Overall (Soria)
The project is about comparison stocks from comapnies who produce vaccine and health care sector in general. 
We want to see if the stock from COVID 19 producer doing better than health care sector. In general, we look for how healthcare choice 
doing good in which area in pandamic. We get data from kaggle for COVID companies vaccine from their stock data which has fours columns of prices: 
Open, High, Low, Close. We focus on looking at Close price. We may creates new columns brom these basic four columns of data if needed. 
Especially when we fo Machine Learning when the data base is clean and bring more information to cluster, and learn further form cluster
# Technologies Used (Soria)
We colect data of csv. The database will try to look at it, learn columns, and have first visualization of data on jupyter lab, and Panda for programming. 
Then use PostgreSQL for database after learning and shaping clean data. The Machine learning will use unsupervised tool to run prediction for data 
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
